<h1>New Venture Discovery</h1>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>This course counts toward the following majors: Entrepreneurship & Innovation, Management & Strategy</p>

<p>Formerly ENTR-462-0</p>

<p>The goal of New Venture Discovery is to help you better understand how high-growth ventures are conceived, tested and validated—and to give you frameworks, tools and practical advice to help you build your own business ideas. This course focuses on the “discovery process”, ground zero in the business formation stage, where the goal is to achieve product/market fit. Is there any inherent interest in your idea? Where is your idea strong and where is it vulnerable? The course is designed to help you test and answer these fundamental questions around business viability, with the added constraint of having limited resources available. The goal is to get you as far as you can, with as little as you can, as fast as you can!</p>
<p>The class is taught a lot like a lab course might be taught in the sciences. Students form into teams and begin the class with nothing more than an idea or a problem that they think is worth solving, and from it they create: a) a number of assumptions and hypotheses around their idea; b) an iterative series of in-market experiments to confirm or deny their hypotheses. The “lab” in which the teams conduct their experiments is the market – seeking the input of actual consumers, customers, partners and others in the value chain of your business. Note: if you’re not prepared to get out of the Jacobs Center (and often Evanston) to conduct the necessary fieldwork, you should not take this class. </p>
<p>Lastly, if you’re conversant in design thinking methodology and/or have a fundamental working knowledge of the Business Model Canvas, you may not want to take this class, as three of the ten sessions have a design thinking component and the BMC is a framework used throughout the class. (If you fit in this category, you can likely waive the class for your entrepreneurship concentration.) Note: This course may not be dropped after the second week of the quarter.</p>
